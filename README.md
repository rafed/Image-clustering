# Image clustering.

A small 350 line code image processor that clusters colors in images. K-means clustering algorithm was used to do this. You can tweak several attributes to see different effects!

Original    |  Averaged - 2 clusters	| Averaged - 6 clusters
:-------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|
![Original](/img/original)  | ![Averaged 2](/img/avg2)	|  ![Averaged 6](/img/avg6)

Lenna	|	Colored - 2 clusters	|	Colored - 10 clusters
:-------------:|:---------------:|:----------:|
![Lenna](/img/lenna) | ![Colored 2](/img/len2)	| ![Colored 10](/img/len10)
